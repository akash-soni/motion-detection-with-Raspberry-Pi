Detect when there is movement.
If there ismovement, check that the movement has been detected for 3 full consecutive seconds.
If yes, check that we didnâ€™t take a photo in the last 60 seconds.
If yes, then print a message to say we are going to take a photo and send it by email.
Also, power on one LED when the PIR sensor detects movement.
